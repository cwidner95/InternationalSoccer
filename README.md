# International Soccer Matches: Advanced Analysis
Using Python to clean, wrangle, and analyze a dataset containing the results of senior international soccer matches. A Tableau storyboard was then created to present findings.
## Introduction
Using a dataset containing the resutls of interational soccer matches from 1872 to 2024, execute multiple analytical methods to discover findings.

The analytical methods used are as follows:
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Geographical Analysis
- Linear Regression
- K-Means Clustering
- Time Series Analysis
## Key Questions
- How many goals are scored by the home/away team in a typical soccer match?
- What stats (goals for/against, goal difference etc.) lead to more success?
- What countries experience higher/lower scoring games?
- What countries experience more blowouts/close games?
- What effect does playing frendlies have on tounrament results?
- How has the game changed over time?
## Data
[International football results from 1872 to 2024](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/martj42/international-football-results-from-1872-to-2017?select=results.csv) - This dataset taken from Kaggle contains the results of over 47,000 international soccer matches from 1872 to 2024.
## Tools
The data was analyzed using Python and the following libraries:
- Pandas: For data analysis
- Numpy: For mathematical equations
- Seaborn: For data visualizations
- Matplotlib: For data visualizations
- Folium: For geographical analysis
- Scikit-learn: For linear regression and clustering analysis and machine learning
## Visualization
Visualizations can be found in the **04 Analysis** folder above. A [Tableau Storyboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/colin.widner/viz/InternationalSoccerMatches/InternationalSoccerMatches) for presenting findings was also created.
